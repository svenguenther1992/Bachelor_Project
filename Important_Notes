By clicking on the ipynb files, you should be able to see the run code for the two examples and the simulations.

If this is not the case:
First, try to reload the file. If this does not work, try the following:
The ipynb files are python notebook files. Sometimes GitHub struggles a bit with displaying these files.
You may take the code and run it in Google Collaboratory.
To replicate the findings, I can send you the dataset (if you are a supervisor), which should be stored in your google drive.
With this setup you should be able to arrive at the same results.

Alternatively, the code can be run from any other IDE (only the import of the data changes).
