# Bachelor_Project
This repository contains all code for my bachelor project.
The Examples and Simulations (Simulation1 and Simulation2) are .ipynb (python notebook) files, so the run code can be displayed.
The Simulations are also given as .py files that can be downloaded and run from the console or any Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
This allows to use the functions to extend upon the simulations treated in this bachelor project.
Note: The simulations run everything with one function. By changing the input to the function, one may run the simulation with other sample sizes, means, variances, correlations, etc.
