# Bachelor_Project
This repository contains all code for my bachelor project.
The Examples and Simulations (Simulation1 and Simulation2) are .ipynb (python notebook) files, so the run code can be displayed.
The Simulations are also given as .py files that can be downloaded and run from the console or any Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
This allows to use the functions to extend upon the simulations treated in this bachelor project.
Note: The simulations run everything with one function. By changing the input to the function, one may run the simulation with other sample sizes, means, variances, correlations, etc.

In the case that the .ipynb files are not correctly displayed in GitHub:
Normally, by clicking on the .ipynb files (i.e. the Example and Simulation1 & Simulation2 files), the run code should be displayed.
However, sometimes GitHub struggles to correctly show the files at first.
First, try to reload the file a few times. If this does not work, try the following:
You may take the code and run it in Google Collaboratory or Jupyter Notebook.
To replicate the findings, I can send you the dataset (if you are a supervisor), which should be stored in your google drive.
With this setup you should be able to arrive at the same results.
Alternatively, the code can be run from any other IDE (only the import of the data changes).
