# Bachelor_Project
This repository contains all code for my bachelor project.
The Examples are .ipynb (python notebook) files, so the run code can be displayed.
The Simulations are .py files that can be downloaded and run from the console or any Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
Note: The simulations run everything with one function. By changing the input to the function, one may run the simulation with other sample sizes, means, variances, correlations, etc.
